	Due to the pandemic, all tutoring is currently online!  
	<br><br>	
		Luckily I've already been using Zoom as a tutoring platform for several years--
		it has a great whiteboard tool which is perfect for writing out math/physics equations.  Students can email/text me questions, or even share 
		their screens with me live during the session to go over problems.
		
		<br><br>
		If you are hesitant to do online tutoring, please give it a try--I myself wasn't too keen on the idea when I first started tutoring but after discovering how far videochatting
		technology has come, I'm a total proponent of it!
