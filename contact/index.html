	<p>
	If you're interested in setting up a tutoring session, or a consultation, send me an <a href="mailto:cachubak@gmail.com">email</a> with the following info:
 
  <li>Name
  <li>Grade Level
  <li>Subject(s) you're interested in
  <li>Available Day(s)/Time(s)
  <li>Location
  <li>Timeline/Goals - Is there a test you're studying for? Did you do badly on the midterm 
  but want to ace the final? Do you need to review concepts over the summer before starting a new semester?
