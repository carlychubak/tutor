Carly Chubak is a former astrophysicist currently working in the arts. 
If you need help with both right- and left-brained subjects, look no further! 
Carly double majored in Physics and Astrophysics at UC Berkeley and graduated 
at the top of her class, giving the commencement speech at graduation. Next, she 
worked in astronomy research and optical test engineering (she designed 
software and tests for distortion analysis of spaceborne telescopes). After a few 
years she decided to go back to school--this time for a BFA in Fine Art from 
ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, where she graduated as valedictorian 
in December 2017 (and gave another commencement speech)!

Carly grew up in Los Angeles and is looking forward to helping students in the area reach 
their goals in getting into colleges and succeeding in classes!
